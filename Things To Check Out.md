Here are things that I think that you should check out:

#Podcasts
Podcasts are a great way to take in information. Here are a few that I recomend:

####[Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm)
Podcasts started in 2013 started by [Marco Arment](https://marco.org), [Casey Liss](https://www.caseyliss.com), and [John Siracusa](http://hypercritical.co). Talks ostesnibly about technology, though there is discussion of cars and other various topics tucked in the show. Typically around an 1.5 and 2 hours. They [do livestream their broadcasts](http://atp.fm/live/), usally every Wenesday at 9PM. Podcast feed version comes out every Thursday or Friday.

####[The Talk Show with John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/)
An interview show hosted by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net), featuring an assortment of Apple commentators and journalists.

####[Hypercritcal (Retired)](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical)
The tagline for Hypercritical is: "A weekly talk show ruminating on exactly what is wrong in the world of Apple and related technologies and businesses. Nothing is so perfect that it can't be complained about. Hosted by [John Siracusa](https://twitter.com/siracusa) and [Dan Benjamin](http://twitter.com/danbenjamin)" This show ended in December in 2012, but it still does have valuable discussion of the state of Apple and related techoligies, with John Siracusa's uncanny abillity to see what is wrong with something. Definatly a must-listen.

####[Hello Internet](http://hellointernet.fm)
There really is no way to describe Hello Internet except that it contains insightful and entertaing discussion on pretty much anything. Start on episode 1 and go all the way up to 53(or whatever the latest episode is at the time of reading), you'll get hooked.

####[Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm/)
Relay FM is not just one podcast, it's a whole network of podcasts, hosting podcasts with topics all the way from [gaming](https://www.relay.fm/isometric), [to technology](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade), [to pens](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict), and all the way to [space travel](https://www.relay.fm/liftoff) and [gender equallity](https://www.relay.fm/ltoe), [plus more](https://www.relay.fm/shows).


#Things to Read
Like podcasts, reading is also a great way to absorb information. Here's some recommended reading for you:

####[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/)
The Daring Fireball blog is run by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber), and is really made up of two components: the [linkblog](https://daringfireball.net/linked/) and the [articles](https://daringfireball.net/archive/). The linkblog is an assortment of links from the web, with Gruber's commentary. There are also articles that he writes, ostensiblly about Apple and other players in the technology field. Daring Fire has had some of the most insightful commentary on Apple I've ever seen, so you should really subscribe to it in your RSS reader, follow it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daringfireball), whatever floats your boat.

####[John Siracusa's OS X Reviews (Retired)](http://hypercritical.co/2015/04/15/os-x-reviewed)
John Siracusa has also reviewed every release of OS X for 15 years, from Mac OS X 10.0 to OS X 10.10 Yosemite. He has stopped for many reasons, but reading all of them can give you insights on the history of the Mac, the core internals of OS X, and great discussion on Apple's GUI design. Another must-read.



#Apps

####[Overcast](https://overcast.fm)
I recommended a lot of lot of podcasts in the above sections, so you will need an app to listen to them. Overcast contains many useful features:

* Smart Speed - Smart Speed dynamically shortens silences in talk shows. Conversations still sound natural.
* Voice Boost - Boost and normalize volume so every show is loud, clear, and at the same volume. Listen in more places, such as noisy cars, and still hear what everyone says without cranking the volume so high for quiet people that the loud ones blow your ears out.
* Smarter Playlists - Create show priorities, filters, and sorting rules, or keep it simple with one big list.

Overcast is free, and to suppor [the developer](https://marco.org/about), there is a [voluntary patronage](https://marco.org/2015/10/09/overcast2).
