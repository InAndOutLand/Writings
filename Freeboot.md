#Freeboot Trolls
Patent trolls are people (or compainies, more rather) who make a "fake patent," in essence, claim that someone has infringed on that patent, and then, that someone will probably settle to avoid the useless-ness that is going to trial in court. Profit is made for the patent trolls, that's why they exist. Patent trollls are one of the main thing that's wrong with the patent system.

There's also another type of troll that's been in the news lateley. They're **freebot trolls**. 

Now, [freebooting][viewjacking] is a practice where by a person or coporation will take someone else's content and will provide no credit to you. It's copyright infringment in a nutshell.

They've been in the news lately mainly because of two things: the YouTube [ContentID system][CID] and what's been dubbed ["Facebook Freebooting"][fb]. This article is about the former. 

ContentID is a system that automatically detects infringment of content by a person who has used a content owner's property unlawfully. There are ways that you can set up ContentID that allows almost any fair use of content to be labeled as infringment. Now we're running in to the main problem with patent trolls: *fair use of content can be punished unfairly*.

What's more, these freeboot trolls might not even own any content! (just like patent trolls, ironically) And with the way YouTube has set up it's ContentID system, the person or company that has claimed infringment will get all of the advertising revenue from that video, therfore, you have instant profit with little to no work done at all.

Patent trolls and freeboot trolls are the exact same thing, the only difference being the works and the people being trolled.
