#Analog vs. Digital

Ah, the [old debate][deb]. What's better: a [vinyl][v] or a [CD][cd]?

Advocates of anolog technology often state that analog has a ["warmth"][w] to it that just can't be replicated by digital. 

Alas, the "warmth" of analog is a consequence of errors, inaccuracies. A groove in a piece of vinyl creates a desitinctive sound. Same with other analog formats.

It is easy to see why some would prefer these sorts of imperfections in analog mediums. If you have positive memories from a ceartain thing, place, or person, especially in childhood, you become attached to that thing later in life. [It's nostalgia][nos].

These people have probably had pivitol experiences with vinyl or cassette, therefore, the inclination towards those formats. A younger person who grew up with digital equipment may not like the supposed warmth of analog, the same way that an older person dislikes the supposed coldness and harshness of digital.

At the end of the day, the question posed at the beginning of this article should go like this: What medium provides the most accurate representation of the source material?

The answer to that question is digital. Most analog defenders will state something to the effect of how [quantization errors][q] degrade the quallity of the original analog vibrations. This, for many reasons explained in [this video,][sig] is simpily not true. To sum it all up: Contrary to popular belief, a digital medium will **not** produce discrete signals. View [the video][sig] linked above for more detail.

One of digital's strengths is how you can reproduce analog imperfections. As digital mediums are inherently neutral, you can mold a digital signal to reproduce analog flaws.

The botttom line is that the best way to capture accurately the original sound waves that traveled through air is digital, *not* analog. All analog techniques produce extra inaccuracies that would be heard with digital techniques. This, however, bars how *you* feel when you're listening to music. For some people, analog sounds better to them than digital. You shouldn't stop someone from expirencing music in the best way for them. But, there should be a clear line when we're talking about analog and digital about the objective and the subjective.

You, your experiences, your prefererences—that's subjective. Science is objective. And now, science¹ says that digital is the most accurate way to record sound.

P.S.: Don't get me started on film versus digital.
