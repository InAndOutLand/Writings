#Fixing Apple Music
There are two main confusions with [Apple Music][am]:

1. Should I use iTunes Store or Apple Music?
2. What's the difference between Apple Music and iTunes Match?

These two problems can be solved in relatively simple ways:

1.  Drop the iTunes Store brand, at least for music. (TV Shows and movies [would have to wait][stream]) Integrate the features of the original iTunes Store by allowing users without an Apple Music subscription to buy music without DRM, as they did before the rebranding. Those with an Apple Music subscription could get the whole of the collection for free, with DRM to limit piracy. If these users leave Apple Music, they could pay a flat fee to remove the DRM and have the songs forever.
2.  Fold [iTunes Match][match] into Apple Music. All songs matched would become a part of your Apple Music library with the same Apple Music subscription.

Now, of course, there are hurdles to getting these solutions in place, like [negotions with the music companies][neg] and the abillity ( or willingness) to make these changes, but at least it's a start.
